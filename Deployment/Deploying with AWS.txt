AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers a variety of tools for deploying applications. In this case, we'll use AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for hosting your application and RDS (Relational Database Service) for managing the MySQL database.

Step 1: Set up an AWS EC2 instance
Log in to AWS Console: Go to AWS Management Console and sign in with your AWS credentials.
Launch an EC2 Instance:
In the EC2 Dashboard, click on Launch Instance.
Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image), for example, a Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.
Choose an instance type like t2.micro (free tier eligible).
Configure instance details and add a security group (ensure that port 22 for SSH and port 80 for HTTP are open).
Launch the instance and generate/download a key pair for SSH access.
